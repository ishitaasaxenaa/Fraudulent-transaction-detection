# Fraud-Detetction
* Worked on a data of having more than 6 million rows to create a fraut detection model.
* Data was heavily imbalanced so techniques like Over sampling using SMOTE, under sampling using RandomSampler and assigning class weights were used.
* The monetary impact was also calculated which shows that after deploying the model bank can save â‚¹2,390,897,622.
* For fast Implementation RAPIDs Library was used which reduced the training time by 60 times (from 30 minutes to 32 seconds)\
